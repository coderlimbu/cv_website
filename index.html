                        During my freelancing period, I successfully developed and deployed a Sales Tracking System using PHP, MySQL, CSS, and JavaScript, which increased
                        the sales team efficiency by 20% at Himalayan Bank Ltd and Shangri-La Development Bank Ltd. The system included user access control, secure password storage with
                        PHP and MD5 encryption for data security, and was designed for easy search and reporting based on criteria like bank branch, 
                        date range, and staff member to enhance user experience.

                        As an IT Officer, I resolve user issues in HIMS and provide staff training at Grande Int'l Hospital to ensure efficient system utilization,
                        increased user satisfaction, and productivity. Additionally, we asn an IT team integrated Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)
                        to enhance medical image storage and retrieval processes, improving workflow. Furthermore, the migration of Grande Int'l Hospital's HIMS 
                        and email server to the cloud was also done thereby enhancing accessibility, scalability, and data security.
